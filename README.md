# java-mailbox
MailBox is a pure Java SE application where multiple senders send messages to a single receiver trough a mailbox with limited buffer. The mailbox is able to manage different priorities among the various sender and is made of 2 thread in order to receive and send messages simultaneously. The application uses shared memory to implement the inter-process communication.

MailBox has been developed as final project for the concurrent programming exam, part of the computer engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
